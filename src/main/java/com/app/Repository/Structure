Principles

Atomic - if the full transaction doesn't finish the db does a rollback
Consistent - if part of a transaction doesn't meet integrity checks it will be rolled back
Isolated - each transaction needs to put in a queue and done one at a time
Durable - ensuring that the transactions will persist once completed
